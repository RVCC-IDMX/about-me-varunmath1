            <h2>The Adventures of Sherlock Homes </h2>

            <div>

                <p>"Alas!" replied our visitor, "the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so
                    vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another,
                    that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I
                    tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his
                    soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the
                    manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which
                    encompass me."</p>

                <p>"I am all attention, madam."</p>

                <p>"My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the
                    oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey."</p>

                <p>Holmes nodded his head. "The name is familiar to me," said he.</p>

                <p>"The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders
                    into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four
                    successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually
                    completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and
                    the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. The last squire
                    dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only
                    son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance
                    from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his
                    professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a fit of anger,
                    however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler
                    to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment
                    and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.</p>

                <p>"When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General
                    Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at
                    the time of my mother's re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money--not less than 1000 pounds
                    a year--and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision
                    that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly
                    after our return to England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident
                    near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and
                    took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my mother had
                    left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.</p>

                <p>"But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead of making friends and
                    exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke
                    Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to
                    indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper approaching to
                    mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather's case it had, I believe,
                    been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of disgraceful brawls took place,
                    two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the
                    folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable
                    in his anger.</p>

                <p>"Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying
                    over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure.
                    He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to
                    encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would
                    accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on
                    end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he
                    has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by
                    the villagers almost as much as their master.</p>
